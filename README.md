## Upcoming Features

- **Responsive Design**: I did not make the website responsive while developping it (I know that's bad). I'll try to work on this as soon as I find some time to do so.
- **Stripe Integration**: I'd like to try to implement a SAAS like payment system where you would only have access to 2-3 Kanban before having to upgrade to a pro version. I might as well add this feature soon.
